Using the OpenAI API, a base ChatGPT Turbo model was fine-tuned to deliver clear, friendly, and age-appropriate explanations—even when students provide vague or unstructured input.\n",

    "Fine-tuning worked well and successful in shaping the model's responses to better suit its intended audience. The fine-tuned model consistently delivered responses in a more playful, child-friendly tone that matched the goal of building an elementary math tutor. It used metaphors (like toys and pizza), added emojis, and kept the tone encouraging and fun—all of which help make math more engaging for young students.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the base GPT-3.5-turbo model also performed well. It gave accurate and clear answers, and in some cases, was a bit more concise. However, it didn’t always maintain the consistent, imaginative tone or child-oriented language that the fine-tuned version achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both models were capable, but the fine-tuned version better matched the intended teaching style for younger audiences. This shows that fine-tuning can be a powerful tool to adapt a general-purpose model to meet specific communication needs and user groups."

    "- **Metrics Considered**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the scope of our term project and the limited size of our fine-tuning dataset, I focused on the following key metrics to evaluate our model's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Loss: The final training loss achieved was 0.495, indicating that the model effectively minimized errors on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Accuracy: The model attained a training accuracy of 80.9%, reflecting its proficiency in predicting the correct tokens during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics were obtained from the OpenAI fine-tuning dashboard, which provides real-time insights into the model's learning progress .\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Testing and Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the qualitative improvements brought by fine-tuning, I conducted comparative testing between the base model (gpt-3.5-turbo) and fine-tuned model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key observations include:\n",
    "\n",
    " *Enhanced Engagement:* The fine-tuned model consistently incorporated emojis and adopted a more conversational tone, aligning with our objective of creating a friendly math tutor for elementary students.\n",
    "\n",
    " *Improved Clarity:* Explanations provided by the fine-tuned model were more tailored to young learners, using simple language and relatable examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing the importance of human judgment in evaluating generative models, I performed manual reviews of the model's responses. This involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparative Analysis: Assessing outputs from both the base and fine-tuned models to identify improvements in tone, clarity, and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative Feedback: Noting areas where the fine-tuned model excelled or required further refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this evaluation was informal, it provided valuable insights into the model's real-world applicability and effectiveness in achieving our educational goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Token Size Experimentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "One key learning from this project was the impact of the max_tokens parameter on the completeness of the model’s responses. Initially, setting a low max_tokens value resulted in truncated outputs, limiting the model’s ability to deliver full explanations. To address this, the parameter was gradually increased, which enabled the model to generate more comprehensive and coherent responses. This experimentation highlighted the importance of carefully tuning generation parameters to achieve a balance between response quality and resource efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "    \n",
    "Throughout this milestone, I gained several important learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-Tuning Effectiveness:** Even with a modest dataset, fine-tuning can significantly enhance a model's alignment with specific stylistic and functional objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance of Evaluation Metrics:** Monitoring training loss and accuracy provides essential feedback on the model's learning trajectory, while human evaluations offer nuanced insights into its practical performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt and Parameter Tuning:** Adjusting prompt and generation parameters like max_tokens is crucial for optimizing output quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, expanding the dataset and incorporating more structured evaluations would further strengthen the model's capabilities and reliability."

    "Note: The API did not return data for North Carolina, North Dakota, and South Carolina, with a specific message indicating 'Coordinates not found' for these states. This may result from incomplete location data in the API's database. The missing coordinates will impact our later steps when joining data from multiple sources, as we will lack geographic identifiers for these states. Without accurate coordinates, we cannot reliably join or analyze data for these locations alongside other sources. Therefore, these states will be excluded from our analysis."

    "### Ethical Implications of Data Wrangling from the Weather API Data \n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of data wrangling for this project, several transformations were performed to standardize and clean the data, including temperature conversions, categorical grouping, handling missing values, and mapping numerical air quality indices to descriptive labels. Since the data involves public weather and air quality information, itâ€™s generally compliant with data usage regulations, provided we adhere to API terms of service and refrain from personal identification. One risk created by these transformations is the potential misrepresentation of states missing coordinates (e.g., North Carolina, North Dakota, and South Carolina), as excluding them could skew results or limit the geographic scope of the analysis. Assumptions were also made in temperature categorization and handling missing values, which may affect interpretation. Data was sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API, a reputable source for weather and geolocation data, ensuring credibility. The data was acquired in an ethical manner by using a public API with proper attribution. To mitigate any ethical concerns, particularly around the missing data, we explicitly note exclusions and the potential impact on our findings, and refrain from drawing conclusions about those excluded regions."

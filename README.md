# Data Science & AI Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio. This collection showcases a range of hands-on projects Iâ€™ve completed across topics such as data visualization, machine learning, natural language processing, and generative AI.

Each project folder contains its own README with details about the problem addressed, tools and techniques used, and final outcomes. The work reflects practical skills in Python, data analysis, model development, and thoughtful presentation of insights.

## What's Inside

- **AI-Math-Tutor-Chatbot/**  
  Interactive AI-powered math tutor using a fine-tuned ChatGPT Turbo model and Streamlit.

- **COVID19-RAG-Question-Answering/**  
  A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using LangChain and GPT-4 for answering questions on COVID-19 in the U.S.

- **fake-news-detection/**  
  Machine learning-based classifier for detecting fake news articles using NLP techniques.

- **tsa-complaints-analysis/**  
  Trend analysis and visualization of TSA complaint data from U.S. airports.

- **childcare-affordability/**  
  Data storytelling and geographic visualization using the NDCP dataset.

- **customer-churn-prediction/**  
  Predictive modeling of telecom customer churn and analysis of retention strategies.

- **healthcare-readmissions-analysis/**  
  Exploratory analysis of how environmental and demographic factors impact healthcare readmission rates in the U.S.

More projects will continue to be added as I explore new tools, techniques, and areas of interest in data science and AI.

## How to Explore

Each project folder includes:
- A project-specific `README.md` with an overview and key takeaways
- Source code files (`.py`, `.ipynb`)
- Any relevant datasets, images, or reports

You can browse the folders directly or view highlighted summaries through my GitHub Pages site.

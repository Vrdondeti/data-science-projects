# TSA Complaints Analysis: Trends in Air Travel Grievances

## Project Overview

This project analyzes TSA complaint data from U.S. airports spanning 2015 to early 2024. The goal is to identify patterns in passenger dissatisfaction, focusing on complaint frequency, category trends, geographic distribution, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on complaint volumes.

By visualizing the data with both spatial and temporal lenses, the analysis aims to provide TSA officials, airport authorities, and travelers with clear insights into systemic issues affecting air travel experiences.

## Datasets

- **Complaints by Airport**  
  Contains counts and details of TSA complaints aggregated by airport.

- **Complaints by Category**  
  Summarizes complaints grouped by high-level complaint categories.

- **Complaints by Subcategory**  
  Provides finer-grained classification of complaints within categories.

- **IATA/ICAO Airport Codes**  
  Dataset containing airport location data and lookup codes essential for linking complaints to specific airports.

## Dataset Sources

- Complaint data files hosted on GitHub: [tsa-complaint-counts repository] (add link)  
- Airport location and codes: IATA/ICAO datasets  

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GeoPandas / Plotly Express (for geospatial visualizations)  
- Markdown / Blog post for narrative and findings presentation  

## Key Visualizations

- Choropleth map showing total complaints by state  
- Scatter geo plot illustrating airport complaint density  
- Box plots displaying complaint distributions over time  
- Heatmaps representing complaint category trends  
- Time series analysis of complaint volumes month-to-month  

## Summary

This analysis transforms raw TSA complaint data into actionable insights through multi-dimensional visualizations and trend analysis. The project supports efforts to improve air travel by highlighting passenger pain points and geographic hotspots for dissatisfaction.

# Interactive Weather Lookup App (OpenWeatherMap API)

## Project Overview

This Python application provides real-time weather updates by integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can choose to enter either a city/state or ZIP code and receive a detailed, readable weather information. The application supports temperature units in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

The project focuses on clean code structure, modular design, and robust error handling. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate effective API consumption, user interaction, and Python best practices.

## Key Features

- Supports city/state and ZIP code weather lookups
- Performs GEO lookup followed by weather forecast retrieval using latitude and longitude
- Allows users to choose temperature units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin
- Displays:
  - Location (city/state)
  - Current temperature and "feels like"
  - High and low temperatures
  - Humidity, pressure, and weather description
- Handles invalid input gracefully with input validation
- Uses try-except blocks for network error handling and clean user feedback

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenWeatherMap API
- `requests` library
- Clean function-based structure following PEP8
